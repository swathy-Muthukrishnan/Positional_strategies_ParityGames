# Learning positional strategies for Parity Games using Graph Neural Networks

Prior knowledge of the positional strategies for each node in a parity game helps the player to make more informed decisions about which nodes to control, thereby increasing their chances of winning. The winning strategy generated by a PG solver for a player is often a single strategy that is dependent on the algorithm the PGSolver is modelled after. Since there are different algorithms for solving parity games, the strategies given by each of these algorithms have a higher chance of being non-unique. Hence it is more beneficial to learn a set of positional strategies rather than a fixed set of winning strategies. This repository contains a GAT (GATConv + GAT) model that can learn and predict positional strategies for parity games. 

The model takes in the graph representation of the parity games as input and is a part of a two-stage training to generate positional strategies for Parity Games. In the first stage, the previously developed node classifier Model will be used to compute the winning regions of the Parity Games. In the second stage, the predicted winning areas from the 1st stage will be used to compute the positional strategies for each node in the Game.
