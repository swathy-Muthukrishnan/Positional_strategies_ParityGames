# Positional_strategies_ParityGames

Prior knowledge of the positional strategies for each node in a parity game helps the player to make more informed decisions about which nodes to control, thereby increasing their chances of winning. The winning strategy generated by a PG solver for a player is often a single strategy that is dependent on the algorithm the PGSolver is modelled after. Since there are different algorithms for solving parity games, the strategies given by each of these algorithms have a higher chance of being non-unique. Hence it is more beneficial to learn a set of positional strategies rather than a fixed set of winning strategies. This repository contains a GAT (GATConv + GAT) model that can learn and predict positional strategies for parity games. 

The model takes in the graph representation of the parity games as input and is a part of a two-stage training to generate positional strategies for Parity Games. In the first stage, the previously developed node classifier Model will be used to compute the winning regions of the Parity Games. In the second stage, the predicted winning areas from the 1st stage will be used to compute the positional strategies for each node in the Game.

# Two class and Three class classification 
 
(The Twwo class and three class spcification can be set through the Wandb.py script) 

The Two class classification model predicts the positional startegies for player 0
    Class Labels: 0 - The edge is not a psoitional winning strategy for player 0
                  1 - The edge is a psoitional winning strategy for player 0
  
The three class classification model predicts the positional stategies for both player 0 and player 1
    Class Labels: 0 - The edge is not a psoitional winning strategy for player 0 and player 1
                  1 - The edge is a psoitional winning strategy for player 0
                  2 - The edge is a psoitional winning strategy for player 1
